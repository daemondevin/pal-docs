# <i class="icon-book"></i> The PAF Docs

## Preface <i class="icon-help-circled"></i>
The documentation you will find here is (or will be over time) a collection of help files and guides mostly focused on the making of `PAFs` (short for and refers to a portable application that adheres to and complies with the <a href="http://portableapps.com/manuals/PortableApps.comLauncher/ref/paf/index.html#paf" target="_blank" title="PortableApps.com Format™ Specification">*PortableApps.com Format™*</a>. I'll be using `PAF` as the term in reference to *PortableApps.com Format* henceforth). Because I am only just one man who has to live outside of my computer, this will take sometime to finish (if ever) so please forgive me on it's incompleteness. This will also serve as a reference/cheat-sheet for those who need a quick reminder on certain functions and macros for use within the `custom.nsh` file.

I've started this project because, in my humble opinion, the official documentation which is supplied with `PAL` (an acronym for <a href="http://portableapps.com/apps/development/portableapps.com_launcher" target="_blank">*PortableApps.com Launcher*</a>. From now on, I'll be using the term `PAL` in reference to the *PortableApps.com Launcher*) by [PA.c](http://portableapps.com/%22PortableApps.com%22)  (an acronym for <a href="http://portableapps.com/" target="_blank">*PortableApps.com*</a>. From now on, I'll be using the term `PA.c` to reference *PortableApps.com*.) doesn't have any solid information on the power and complexities it's framework has. So I've taken it upon myself to begin working on this *unofficial* (but my official) guide to making a `PAF` with `PAL`. 

I assume that you've read and gone over the [official documentation](https://portableapps.com/manuals/PortableApps.comLauncher/%22PortableApps.com%20Launcher%20Documentation%22) because if you haven't than you're going to have a rough time understanding certain topics that I'll be discussing here considering I will be referencing concepts and practices from their help files. If you have not read or at least skimmed through the official documentation than I suggest you do so however if you haven't, I have linked to the topics on these tutorial pages to the topics on the official online documentation for quick access for your convenience.

## Enthusiasts <i class="icon-chat-empty"></i>
Aside from the growing populace at PortableApps.com, there is a small <a href="https://discord.gg/mMfFrk4" target="_blank" title="PAF Community">community of enthusiasts</a> on the <a href="https://discordapp.com/" target="_blank">Discord</a> chat platform that will be more then happy to help answer any of the questions that may arise during your quest for PAF enlightenment if you cannot find what you are looking for here.

## A PAFers Lineup <i class="icon-info-circled"></i>
If you haven't already, download the required applications and files you will need before you proceed with making a `PAF` with this guide. Grab a build of PortableApps.com Installer, PortableApps.com Launcher Generator, and a build of NSIS Portable, you can find the download links to these files below.

I use a modified variant of PAL which I'm currently developing. You can visit the GitHub project page here. It has the makings for better PAF development as the official version hasn't had any updates in several years.
